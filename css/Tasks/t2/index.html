    <p>IIT Bombay was founded in 1958.[7] In 1961, the Parliament decreed IITs as Institutes of National Importance.[8] A committee formed by the Government of India recommended the establishment of four higher institutes of technology to set the direction for the development of technical education in the country in 1946. Planning had begun in 1957 and the first cohort of 100 students was admitted in 1958.[8] Since its establishment in Powai, the institute has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings, with a combined area of more than 2.2 square kilometers.IIT Bombay is known for two- or three-year Master of Technology (M.Tech.), the four-year Bachelor of Science (B.S.), the two-year Master of Science (M.Sc.) and the five-year Inter-Disciplinary Dual-Degree Programme (IDDDP) among many others. It also has a comprehensive graduate program offering doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.[8] It currently has a total of 15 academic departments, 20 additional education centres, a school of excellence and four interdisciplinary programmes including a management programme and industrial design programmes.[9]</p></div>
